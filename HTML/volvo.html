        About Volvo Cars
    </h1>
    <p>
        Volvo Cars headquartered in Torslanda, Gothenburg. The company manufactures SUVs, station wagons, and sedans. The company's main marketing 
        arguments are safety and its Swedish heritage and design.
        Volvo Cars has been separate from its former parent conglomerate and producer of heavy trucks, buses, and construction equipment (among others) 
        AB Volvo since 1999 when AB Volvo sold its automobile division Volvo Cars to Ford Motor Company.[4] On 28 March 2010, Ford sold loss-making 
        Volvo Cars to Geely for $1.8 billion; the deal closed in August 2010.[5][6] Volvo Cars was publicly listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange in 2021,
         though Geely still retains majority ownership. Volvo Cars and AB Volvo share the Volvo logo, and cooperate in running the Volvo Museum.
